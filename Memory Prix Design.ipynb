    "# Memory Prix\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple players roll (or spin) to advance their cars on the track.  If they hit an obstacle (oil slick?), they must do a memory check for the given number of cars.  They must move back one square for every check they get wrong.\n",

    "First to cross the finish line is the winner.\n",

    "    1. All players have a chance to win\n",
    "    2. Players that do better on the memory check have an advantage over multiple games\n",
    "    3. Games take about 10 minutes for 2 players\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's assume that move size is generated from a 1d6, and that each action (move or memory check) takes 15 seconds.  Also, let's assume that each player has a fixed chance of passing a memory check.  We then have the following free parameters\n",

    "    1. Number of squares\n",
    "    2. Number of obstacles\n",
    "    3. Number of memory checks in each obstacle\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that we probably want to bound the number of checks per obstacle so that individual turns are not overly long.  Three seems like a reasonable upper bound (then move + 3 memory checks is a max of 1 minute/turn), but that needs to be tested.\n",

    "As a sanity check, we begin with a direct simulation of game play."
